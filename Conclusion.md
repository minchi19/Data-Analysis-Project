# Coclusions drawn from FIFA 19 dataset


FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Arts' FIFA series. FIFA 19 contains a rich dataset with plenty of attributes covering all aspects of a real-life footballer in an attempt to immitate him as much as possible in the virtual world. This rich dataset provides a huge oppurtunity for us, data scientists or data analysts to analyze and come up with visualizations and patterns. I will try to cover the following:

The dataset distribution based on player nationality, player overall rating, age vs overall rating, player valuation and so on.
The patterns in the dataset
Top football playing Countries, Top Clubs, Top players and so on.



# Following are some interesting conclusions:

-England is represented the most number of players by over 1600 players in the dataset, followed by Germany, Spain, Argentina and France.

-The overall of a player increases as he ages. This continues till about the age of 30 or 31 when the player is at his prime. Post 30, a player starts to decline in performance. We also see that the actual overall and the potential of a player in FIFA 19 come to equal terms at about the age of 29. The potential of a player is a reflection of his overall rating if he reaches his prime.

-The value of a player also increases with age and reaches a maximum at around the age of 31. After 31, the value of a player starts dwindling.

-The valuation of a footballer increases with his overall rating.

-Spain have the highest potential followed closely by Brazil, Argentina and France,

-Spanish giant Real Madrid have the most footballers with an overall rating of above 85. They are followed by Juventus of Italy and Manchester City of England. The top 10 clubs include three each from Spain and England, followed by two from Italy (Juventus and Inter Milan). PSG and Bayern Munich make up the other two.

-Most valued player is Neymar Jr and Highest earner is L. Messi. 

-FC Barcelona and Real Madrid have the highest wage budgets, followed closely by Juventus and Manchester City.

-Vital stats by position: 
-Goalkeepers - Reflexes, Handling and Diving <br>
-Central Defenders - Standing Tackle, Jumping, Marking and Sliding Tackle <br>
-Central Midfielders - Reactions, Short Pass, Ball Control, Vision and Composure <br>
-Wingers - Dribbling, Ball Control, Agility and Reactions <br>
-Strikers - Dribbling, Finishing, Positioning and Reactions.<br>

-The Central Midfielder category contains very defensive players like Kanté and Busquets, as well as Griezmann.

-The top three midfielders - De Bruyne, Modrić and Kroos - appear to be the most well rounded out of the lot however. As a result, it was expected that some stats are only important for certain types of Midfielders, yet some other stats may be integral for all Midfielders.
