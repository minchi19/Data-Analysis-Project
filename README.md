FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Arts' FIFA series. FIFA 19 contains a rich dataset with plenty of attributes covering all aspects of a real-life footballer in an attempt to immitate him as much as possible in the virtual world. This rich dataset provides a huge oppurtunity for us, data scientists or data analysts to analyze and come up with visualizations and patterns. I will try to cover the following:

- The dataset distribution based on player nationality, player overall rating, age vs overall rating, player valuation and so on.
- The patterns in the dataset
- Top football playing Countries, Top Clubs, Top players and so on.
